# 🌌 Custom-3D-Simulation & Rendering-Engine

This is a software rendering simuilation engine developed purely in C++. Witness the intricate details as everything, from triangle rasterization to 3D projection algorithms, is crafted without leaning on any external libraries. Not just that, even foundational elements like matrix functions and font rendering are implemented from the ground up.

## 🎯 Highlights:
-  **Pure C++ Implementation**: Every line, every function, every algorithm is home-brewed, providing an unadulterated C++ experience.
-  **Depth-buffering**: A sophisticated solution to the age-old [painter's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm).
-  **Advanced Triangle Rasterization**: Enhanced with antialiasing and shading calculations for richer visuals.
-  **Optimized Rendering**: Leverage back face culling to reduce render times and enhance performance.
-  **Multiple File Format Support**: In-built capabilities to load wavefront file formats.
-  **Sphere Rendering**: Render spheres without relying on geometry data.
-  **FPS Management**: An in-built FPS counter and limiter ensures your simulations run smoothly.
-  **Pixel Buffer Masking**: Ensure perfection by removing undesired elements like water inside a boat.
-  **Resizable Window**: Adjust the window size on-the-fly without any hiccups, thanks to separate threads managing client messages and the main program.
-  **Triangle Clipping Algorithm**: Optimize the rasterization process, saving computational power.
-  **Font Management**: Load and render custom fonts to add a personal touch.
-  **Fast Intersection Detection**: Quickly detect intersections in triangle meshes.
